            <h2>Studies</h2>
            <p>At the end of the school year, it’s possible that I change my studies.
                In fact, it’s possible that I will go to Bordeaux in a school named INOV
                and more precisely in the axes of Cybersécurité. I am not sure about that
                way because i may stay in BUT R&T and finish my 3 years and if possible
                continue with an engineering school </p>

        <div class="Travail">
            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>
                Later, I would like to work on something that is related to a computer.
                In fact, I have grown up with a lot of technologies in my childhood and
                even my dad is working in a computer related work. Even better, I would
                like to be in a cybersecurity job since I did talk to my father and he
                said that it would perfectly fit with my profile.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="Conditions">
            <h2>Conditions</h2>
            <p>
                In my future work I would love to be able to work from home since it would be easier for me
                And even, my future work is probably making it possible since I want to work in a computer
                Related work and nowadays, everything is connected. I also would like to have
                A car because I like them and it is easier in every day life.
                If i had a last Conditions, it is probably to have some vacations privillege
                so i can travel all over the world. Of course I would work hard to achieve thos holydays.
